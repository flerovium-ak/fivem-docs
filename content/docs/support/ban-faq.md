Global Bans
-----------
Note that bans by the anticheat system are automated, and the bans are not reversible by Cfx or Community staff. The ban will expire automatically, or be removed if the anticheat determines it was incorrect.

Our anticheat system is a robust trip-wire style system which is automated in nature. The system detects the use of external programs which attempt to inject themselves into the FiveM client. If you have been banned by the anticheat, it will indicate so in a message when you connect to a server alongside a Ban ID and the expiration time.

**Important note:** Note that graphic, sound packs and modifications will **not** cause you to be banned by the anticheat system.

When I try to join a server it tells me a component stops me from playing
------------------------------------------------------------------
This occurs when an individual attempts to circumvent their original ban in various forms. The message will indicate the expiration time of the ban.

<br/>

Why aren't cheaters banned instantly?
-------------------------------------
Our anti-cheat relies on a checks and balances system which means that there are a series of checks and balances in place to prevent the anticheat from removing innocent players from the Platform. With this in mind, it may some time before the player is finally banned.

<br/>

False Positives
---------------
The anticheat system goes through a number of tests to ensure that the amount of false positives stay at an absolute minimum.

<br/>

Unauthorized Game Server Provider (GSP)
---------------------------------------
There are situations where you may attempt to join a server and come accross a message indicating that the server you're attempting to join is blocked due to it not being an authorized Game Server Provider (GSP). Based on our [Terms of Service](https://fivem.net/terms) you can see that the only GSP allowed to be used and advertise itself for FiveM is ZAP Hosting.
While that is our only authorized Game Server Provider, you're welcome to use **any** Virtual Private Server or Dedicated Server of your choice as long as you have root access to the server itself.

I found cheats that are undetected! Get em!
-------------------------------------------
Whoa! That's unfortunate, are you sure they still are undetected? Our anticheat system bans are typically slighly delayed, within 24hrs after detection the user is banned. With that being said, we cannot stay on top of them completely without your help, our community is our backbone. If you come across cheats which you feel are undetected and you have the actual files, please feel free to send them to [abuse@fivem.net](mailto:abuse@fivem.net). Additionally, take a look at [this link](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/support/resource-faq/#what-can-i-do-against-cheaters) to see what you can do to help fight against cheaters who may be affecting your server.
